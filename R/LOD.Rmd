Using problem 30, and figuring that there are 15 parentals and two recombinants; furthermore, the probability of getting the disease associated allele in the absence of linkage is 3/4.
```{r}
th <-seq(0.01,.5,.02)
```
Now try a simple calculation, say with theta = .1, and then go back and substitute in the vector
```{r}
lod <-function(th) {
  out <-((1-th)^15*th^2)/(3/4)^17
  log10(out)
}
```

```{r}
plot(th,lod(th))
abline(h=3,col="red")
```
