\title{Compute Summary Statistics from ms Simulations
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}

\description{This is an R encoded version of the Hudson sumstats program.  It accepts x$gametes as input, where x is generated by read.ms.output and returns a data frame of basic statistics

%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
ms.sumstats(ms.raw)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
\item{ms.raw}{raw text output from \code{ms}}
}
  }
\details{
This function largely replicates the executable program sumstats, distributed as part of ms.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with the ms function from the R package phyclust and the read.ms.output function.  Thus, the normal workflow would be as follows:
\enumerate{
\item Run ms (for information see help(ms)), specifying appropriate parameters.  
\item Execute this function, using the output returned by \code{ms}
}
}
\value{
The function returns a data frame, the rows of which are the following for each replicate simulation:

\tabular{ll}{
S \tab Number of segregating sites \cr
pi \tab average pairwise differences between sequences \cr
th.W \tab the Watterson estimator of Theta \cr
Tajima.D \tab Tajima's D statistic \cr
th.H \tab Fay and Wu's estimator of theta \cr
H \tab Fay and Wu's H statistic
}

## Analyze ms run for 20 samples, 1000 replicates, and &theta; set to 10

dat <-ms(nsam=20,nreps=1000,opts=("-t 10")) 
dat.sum <-ms.sumstats(dat)
head(dat.sum)
